# Tio do Pavê - Bot

This project is a Twitter bot for [O Tio do Pavê](https://github.com/thebigfundamentals/Tio-do-Pave).

The bot will post a random joke from O Tio do Pavê database every 2 hours, and will reply to any mention with a random joke.

## New feature (7-5-21) - Request by keyword

Now the bot can be asked to search for a joke that contains a certain keyword. If it finds one, or multiple ones, it will select randomly from the returned array.

It was set using [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit). Twitter has deprecated several endpoints, so adjustments were made.

Shoutout to the great [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman), a great, great teacher and an awesome developer. I've managed to set this bot by watching his videos.
